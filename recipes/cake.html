        <img src="../images/cake.png" alt="cake dish">
        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Moist, flavor-changing, light pound cake. Note: You can change the flavor by using 2/3 cup whipping cream and 1/3 cup flavored coffee creamers (in dairy case). Try mixing some in, they are great.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup butter, room temperature</li>
            <li>3 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>6 eggs, room temperature</li>
            <li>3 cups cake flour</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream, room temperature</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon almond extract (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar, for dusting (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch tube pan.</p></li>
            <li><p>In a large bowl, cream butter for 2 minutes. Add sugar and continue beating for 5 minutes, scraping down bowl occasionally. The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add flour alternately with whipping cream, beginning and ending with flour. Stir in vanilla and almond extract.</p></li>
            <li><p>Spread batter into prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven until a tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 70 minutes. Allow to cool in pan for 15 minutes.</p></li>
            <li><p>Turn cake out onto a cotton dish towel and place on cooling rack covered with cotton towel. When cake is cool, top with confectioners' sugar and serve with fruit or by itself.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Cook's Note:</h4>
        <p>If you're using a dark lined or coated pan, lower the oven temperature to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Bake for the same amount of time.
            but cook same length.</p>
